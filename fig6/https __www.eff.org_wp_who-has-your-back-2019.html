But in their response to calls to remove objectionable content, social media companies and platforms have all too often censored valuable speech. While it is reasonable for companies to moderate some content, no one wins when companies and governments can censor online speech without transparency, notice, or due process.</p><p>This year’s Who Has Your Back report examines major tech companies’ content moderation policies in the midst of massive government pressure to censor. We assess companies’ policies in six categories:</p><ul><li>Transparency in reporting government takedown requests based on <strong>legal requests</strong></li><li>Transparency in reporting government takedown requests alleging <strong>platform policy violations</strong></li><li>Providing <strong>meaningful notice</strong> to users of every content takedown and account suspension</li><li>Providing users with an <strong>appeals process </strong>to dispute takedowns and suspensions</li><li>Transparency regarding <strong>the number of appeals</strong></li><li>Public support of the <strong>Santa Clara Principles</strong></li></ul><p>These categories build on last year’s first-ever censorship edition of Who Has Your Back<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in an effort to foster improved content moderation best practices across the industry. Even with stricter criteria, we are pleased to see several companies improving from last year to this year.</p><p>Only one company—<strong>Reddit</strong>—earned stars in all six of these categories. And two companies—<strong>Apple </strong>and<strong> GitHub</strong>—earned stars in five out of six categories, both falling short only on appeals transparency. We are pleased to report that, of the 16 companies we assess, twelve publicly endorse the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation,<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> indicating increasing industry buy-in to these important standards.</p><p>Some content moderation best practices are seeing wider adoption than others. Although providers increasingly offer users the ability to appeal content moderation decisions, they do not as consistently provide users with clear notice and transparency regarding their appeals processes. According to the policies of several providers, users have the ability to appeal all content removals, but they may not receive notification that their content has been removed in the first place. This creates a critical gap in information and context for users trying to navigate takedown and suspension decisions—and for advocates striving to better understand opaque content moderation processes. We will continue encouraging more consistent adoption of the best practices identified in this report, and closing such critical information gaps, moving forward.</p><p class="center-image"><a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2019/06/11/whyb_2019_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/files/2019/06/11/download-report.png" alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a>     <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2019/06/11/whyb-table-4b_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/files/2019/06/11/download-chart_0.png" alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a></p><h2><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In the aftermath of horrific violence in New Zealand and Sri Lanka and viral disinformation campaigns about everything from vaccines to elections, governments have made unprecedented demands for online platforms to police speech. And companies are rushing to comply. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg even published an op-ed<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> imploring governments for more regulation “governing the distribution of harmful content.”</p><p>But in their response to calls to remove objectionable content, social media companies and platforms have all too often censored valuable speech. Marginalized groups are particularly impacted by this increased content policing, which impairs their ability to use social media to organize, call attention to oppression, and even communicate with loved ones during emergencies. And the processes used by tech companies to moderate content are often tremendously opaque. While it is reasonable for companies to moderate some content, no one wins when companies and governments can censor legitimate online speech without transparency, notice, or due process.</p><p>This year’s Who Has Your Back report assesses company policies in these areas in the midst of significant government pressure to censor. Along with increased government action to mandate certain kinds of content moderation, some companies reported an uptick in the number of government requests for platforms to take down content based on claims of legal violations. At Twitter, for example, such requests increased 84 percent and affected more than twice as many accounts from 2017 to 2018.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p><p>After the attacks in Christchurch—which left 51 people dead, injured more than 40 others, and were livestreamed on Facebook—New Zealand released the Christchurch Call, a plan to combat terrorism and violent extremism online. While the plan has valuable components addressing the need for governments to deal with the root causes of extremism, it also asks governments to consider developing industry standards and regulations, and asks companies to employ upload filters to detect and block extremist content.</p><p>With other freedom of expression advocates, we at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have raised concerns<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> that the plan could lead to blunt measures that undermine free speech. Nonetheless, eighteen countries, as well as providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft, signed on to the call. The United States declined, citing First Amendment concerns.</p><p>Other countries took action before the Christchurch Call was unveiled. Australia passed legislation that would penalize companies for failing to quickly remove videos containing “abhorrent violent content” from social media platforms, with fines as high as 10% of annual revenue and potential jail time for executives.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> European Union lawmakers approved a plan requiring platforms to remove terrorist content within one hour of being notified about it by authorities.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> The United Kingdom proposed the creation of a regulatory body to enforce rules against online misinformation, hate speech, and cyberbullying.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> And in 2017, Germany passed the “Network Enforcement Law,” which has already led to the deletion of legitimate expressions of opinion.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p><p>In authorizing new regulations that carry potential punishments in the billions of dollars and even possible jail time, governments seem to be sending a clear message to platforms: police your users, or else. This could easily inspire platforms—which already make too many unacceptable content moderation mistakes—to over-censor and effectively silence people for whom the Internet is an irreplaceable forum to express ideas, connect with others, and find support.</p><h2><a id="scope"></a>Scope</h2><p>This report provides objective measurements for analyzing the content moderation policies of major technology companies. We focus on a handful of specific, measurable criteria that reflect attainable best practices.</p><p>We assess those criteria for 16 of the biggest online platforms that publicly host a large amount of user-generated content. The group of companies and platforms we assess does not include infrastructure providers (e.g. Cloudflare), file hosting services (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive), communications providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), or search engines (e.g. Bing, Google).</p><p>The scope of this report does not include several types of censorship. We do not cover removals of child exploitation imagery, or intellectual property removals, restrictions, and reporting. Further, for the two “app stores” we evaluate this year, we limit the scope of our review to developer accounts and the apps themselves.</p><p>As tech companies face more pressure to take down content, the line between government censorship and platform censorship is increasingly hard to draw. With this in mind, this report does not just assess companies’ reporting and handling of explicit government takedown requests. We also look more comprehensively at whether notice and appeals processes apply to <em>all</em> content takedowns and account suspensions, regardless of whether they are driven by government pressure, company content rules, or some combination of the above.</p><h2><a id="major-findings-and-trends"></a>Major Findings and Trends</h2><p>Our major findings include:</p><ul><li>Only one company—<strong>Reddit</strong>—received credit in all six categories.</li><li>Two companies—the <strong>Apple App Store </strong>and<strong> GitHub</strong>—received credit in five out of six categories, falling short only on appeals transparency.</li><li>Of the 16 companies we assess, twelve publicly endorse the <strong>Santa Clara Principles</strong>, indicating increasing industry buy-in to these important standards.</li><li>Although providers are increasingly offering users the ability to appeal content moderation decisions, <strong>notice policies and appeals transparency are not keeping up</strong>.</li></ul><p>We are pleased to announce that <strong>Reddit</strong> earned stars in every category we evaluated in this year’s report, and the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> earned stars for all but one of this year’s categories. These companies stand out as examples of strong content moderation policies across the board.</p><p>Notably, two of this year’s highest-scoring companies have unique models of user-generated content and communities. Reddit’s sub-reddit model relies on moderators to create and enforce community norms, setting the context for the site-wide corporate policies this report assesses. And GitHub is one of the largest sites hosting user-generated code and the communities that form around it. Both companies have managed to meet industry best practices while also adapting those best practices to the community models and types of content they host. Both Reddit and GitHub also employ small policy and content moderation teams relative to some of the other companies we assess this year. If they can achieve this outstanding level of transparency and accountability with regard to content takedowns and account suspensions, it’s reasonable to expect other companies to also meet that standard.</p><p>Even with stricter criteria this year, several companies improved their scores from the 2018 report to the 2019 report. In particular, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Reddit </strong>both committed to more comprehensive notice policies. In another example of improvement, <strong>Pinterest</strong> made its transparency reporting more detailed. It provides a good example for other companies, like Twitter and LinkedIn, that do provide data on government takedown requests, but not at the level of detail this report requires. <strong>Snap</strong> has also made notable improvements. Despite the fact that its primarily ephemeral content complicates the logistics of implementing some processes like appeals, it has improved its transparency reporting and indicated a commitment to content moderation best practices going forward.</p><p>We are also pleased to see over half the companies in this year’s report publicly supporting the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation. These principles outline a set of minimum content moderation policy standards in three areas: transparency, notice, and appeals. This year’s Who Has Your Back criteria roughly mirror these areas, and reflect continued corporate progress toward fulfilling the spirit of the principles. The principles were released by EFF in conjunction with the ACLU of Northern California, Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, New America’s Open Technology Institute, and a group of academic experts and advocates. Now, one year later, we are glad to see industry actors joining civil society and academia in indicating their support for the principles moving forward.</p><p>Out of this year’s six star categories, notice posed one of the biggest challenges, with only four of the companies assessed in this year’s report meeting our criteria for meaningful notice. Executing a comprehensive notice policy requires a large, ongoing, potentially unpredictable commitment of resources. However, notice remains a critical component of accountable content moderation. Meaningful notice can build trust between users and platforms by ensuring that users affirmatively know when and why a platform has removed their content. Without timely, informative, on-the-record notice, users are left grasping for evidence with which to appeal to companies directly. Further, notice of legal takedown requests in particular can give users the information they need to draw public attention to government targeting and censorship.</p><p>Many companies in this year’s report do provide another critical component of accountable content moderation: an appeals process. While we applaud the eleven companies that allow users to appeal content takedowns and account suspensions, notice is still a missing piece for many. This leads to a challenge for users: how can you utilize an appeals process if you are not notified that there is something to appeal? Without the knowledge that an enforcement decision has been made and why, users are not in a strong position to take advantage of mechanisms to challenge it.</p><p>Another missing piece of the puzzle is transparency about appeals. Only one company—Reddit, this year’s sole all-star—provided transparency about the total number of appeals it had received. Further, Reddit published the aggregate outcomes of appeals, reporting the percentage of appeals resolved in favor of or against the appeal. Without this kind of information, it is impossible to begin to understand the context of an individual appeal, or to interpret how a company deals with appeals more broadly. Of course, there are no ideal numbers here. Receiving zero total appeals does not necessarily indicate a company employs perfect content moderation, and a large number of appeals does not mean it is making mistakes. Taking steps to provide transparency around appeals can, however, give the public a window into what is currently an opaque process at most companies.</p><p>Transparency, notice, appeals, and other areas of content moderation policy and ethics are complex, and cannot fit neatly into just six criteria. This report strives to build on last year’s initial censorship edition of Who Has You Back as we continue to push companies toward wider adoption of content moderation best practices.</p><h2><a id="overview-of-criteria"></a>Overview of Criteria</h2><p>Only <strong>publicly available </strong>statements can qualify for credit in this report. Positions, practices, or policies that are conveyed privately or in internal corporate standards, regardless of how laudable, are not factored into our decisions to award companies credit in any category.</p><p>Requiring public documentation serves several purposes. First, it ensures that companies cannot quietly change an internal practice in the future in response to government pressure, but must also change their publicly posted policies—which observers can note and document. Second, by asking companies to put their positions in writing, we can examine each policy closely and prompt a larger public conversation about what standards tech companies should strive for. Third, it helps companies review one another’s policies around content moderation, which can serve as a guide for startups and others looking for examples of best practices.</p><p>In this report, we strive to offer ambitious but practical standards. To that end, we only include criteria that at least one major company has already adopted. This ensures that we are highlighting existing and achievable, rather than theoretical, best practices.</p><p>We analyzed six criteria for this report:</p><h3><a id="transparent-about-legal-takedown-requests"></a>Transparent About Legal Takedown Requests</h3><p>To earn a star in this category, the service provider must regularly publish records of government requests for takedowns based on claims of legal violations, for instance, in its transparency report. This should include, at a minimum, the information necessary to determine:</p><ul><li>the number of requests received,</li><li>the country from which the request originated,</li><li>the number of requests acted upon and/or the number of posts removed or restricted or accounts suspended, and</li><li>for service providers reporting on multiple products/platforms, the product/platform associated with the requested content or account.</li></ul><p>Takedown requests include requests to restrict public access to a post, including geographic limitation, and account suspensions that limit access to posts for a period of time.</p><p>Reporting must distinguish legal takedown requests from platform policy takedown requests.</p><p>A request is categorized as a “government request” if it is provided through official channels (such as an order issued by a competent judicial authority); if the requestor identifies themselves as a government official or relies upon their governmental position or authority; or if the provider otherwise is aware a government is being represented in the request.</p><p>If the service provider is restricted by applicable law from disclosing the request, it may delay including the request until that restriction is lifted and still get credit in this category.</p><h3><a id="transparent-about-platform-policy-takedown-requests"></a>Transparent About Platform Policy Takedown Requests</h3><p>To earn a star in this category, the service provider must regularly publish records of content or account restrictions based upon identifiable government allegations of violations of the provider’s policies, such as Terms of Service or Community Standards, regardless of whether the request came through channels for government requests or through customer service channels. This includes government requests alleging facts that lead to a content or account restriction based on a provider's policies.</p><p>The provider’s reporting should include, at a minimum, the information necessary to determine:</p><ul><li>the number of requests received,</li><li>the country from which the request originated, and</li><li>the number of requests acted upon and/or the number of posts removed or restricted or the number of accounts suspended, and</li><li>for service providers reporting on multiple products/platforms, the product/platform associated with the requested content or account.</li></ul><p>Reporting must distinguish legal takedown requests from platform policy takedown requests.</p><p>A request is identifiably from a government if it is provided through official channels (such as an order issued by a competent judicial authority); if the requestor identifies themselves as a government official or relies upon their governmental position or authority; or if the provider otherwise is aware a government is being represented in the request.</p><h3><a id="provides-meaningful-notice"></a>Provides Meaningful Notice</h3><p>To earn a star in this category, the service provider must publicly commit to provide meaningful notice to users of every removal and suspension, unless prohibited by law, in very narrow and defined emergency situations,<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> or if doing so would be futile or ineffective.<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p><p>For legal takedowns and suspensions, the notice must (1) identify the specific content that allegedly violates the law, and (2) inform the user that it was a legal takedown request. If the takedown is a “geoblock”—that is, a content restriction limited to the jurisdiction where the provider is legally required to restrict it—then the users must also be notified of the geographic scope of the takedown.</p><p>For policy takedowns and suspensions, this notice must (1) identify the specific content that allegedly violates a provider policy, and (2) include the specific provider policy the content allegedly violates.</p><h3><a id="appeals-mechanisms"></a>Appeals Mechanisms</h3><p>To earn a star in this category, the service provider must publicly commit to provide users with an appeals process.</p><p>This appeals process must provide users with effective mechanisms to appeal all provider-policy based content and account restriction decisions, including <em>during</em> temporary suspensions. Upon a successful appeal, the account or material must be reinstated promptly.</p><h3><a id="appeals-transparency"></a>Appeals Transparency</h3><p>The provider must also regularly publish records of appeals and their aggregate outcomes, for instance in a transparency report. This should include, at a minimum, the information necessary to determine the total number of appeals filed.</p><h3><a id="santa-clara-principles"></a>Santa Clara Principles</h3><p>To earn a star in this category, the service provider must publicly support the Santa Clara Principles. This does not require the service provider to meet the principles, but rather to indicate their endorsement of them. While the previous five criteria reflect a service provider’s current implementation, this one indicates their commitment to support content moderation best practices moving forward.</p><p><em>(All criteria exclude spam, phishing, and child exploitation imagery.)</em></p><h2><a id="company-reports"></a>Company Reports</h2><h3 style="text-align: center;"><a id="apple-app-store"></a>Apple App Store</h3><p class="center-image"><img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/09/star_0.png" alt="star" />   <img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/09/star_0.png" alt="star" />   <img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/09/star_0.png" alt="star" />   <img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/09/star_0.png" alt="star" /> <img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/10/checklist-1.png" alt="gray star" />  <img style="height: 50px; width: 50px;" src="/files/2018/05/09/star_0.png" alt="star" /></p><p><strong>Transparent About Legal Takedown Requests. </strong>Apple has publicly committed to reporting government takedowns in its future transparency reports:</p><blockquote><p>Starting with the Transparency Report period July 1 - December 31, 2018, Apple will report on Government requests to take down Apps from the App Store in instances related to alleged violations of legal and/or policy provisions.

We don't offer appeals for violations with extreme safety concerns, such as child exploitation imagery.</p></blockquote><p>Because Facebook’s policy does not further explain the full scope of “extreme safety concerns” that fall outside the scope of “the vast majority of violation types,” it does not earn a star in this category.</p><p><strong>Transparent About Appeals.</strong> While Facebook reports the number of appeals and rate of content restoration in its Community Guidelines report, that reporting is limited to nine categories of standards violations: adult nudity and sexual activity, bullying and harassment, child nudity and sexual exploitation of children, fake accounts, hate speech, regulated goods (drugs and firearms), spam, terrorist propaganda, and violence and graphic content.

Our Terms of Service prohibit unlawful content, so if a State actor were to report unlawful content as a violation of our Terms of Service, we would process that as a government takedown request. That includes confirming that the request is coming from a genuine State official and posting the government’s request. Conversely, when a non-State actor reports unlawful content as violating our Terms of Service, we do not feel compelled to take it down in the same way that we do when the takedown is demanded by a State official. GitHub does not receive other kinds of content-related requests from States.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Provides Meaningful Notice. </strong>GitHub publicly commits to notifying users of every content restriction and account suspension with the reason for removal.

We provide this notice except where legally prohibited or when technical constraints prevent us from doing so.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Allows Appeals.</strong> While Facebook allows users to appeal takedowns, it does not commit to allowing appeals for all Community Standards violation types:</p><blockquote><p>Today, we offer appeals for the vast majority of violation types. We don't offer appeals for violations with extreme safety concerns, such as child exploitation imagery.</p></blockquote><p>Because Facebook’s policy does not further explain the full scope of “extreme safety concerns” that fall outside the scope of “the vast majority of violation types,” it does not earn a star in this category.</p><p>For disabled accounts, Instagram does not clearly commit to allowing appeals for all provider policy-based suspensions (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>If you think your account was disabled by mistake, you <strong>may</strong> be able to appeal the decision by opening the app, entering your username and password and following the on-screen instructions.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Transparent About Appeals.</strong> While Instagram’s parent company Facebook reports the number of appeals and rate of content restoration in its Community Guidelines report, that reporting is limited to nine categories of standards violations: adult nudity and sexual activity, bullying and harassment, child nudity and sexual exploitation of children, fake accounts, hate speech, regulated goods (drugs and firearms), spam, terrorist propaganda, and violence and graphic content.
